# Election_Analysis
using Python
## Overview of Election Audit
  The Election Audit data is analyzed in this challenge to extract the winning candidates and winning counties based on the number of votes. This analysis is carried out using Python decision making tools and also printing the information extracted for a easy to understand presentation in form of a text file. 
## Election Audit Result
  * Election Results/total votes:
    The data in the CSV file is evaluated to determine the total number of votes casted across the counties and all the candidates combined. It basically counted the number of rows which represented a vote.
  * County votes:
    The county votes are presented next where the number of votes casted and the percentage of votes casted for each county are listed.

 ## Election Audit Summary
   In summary, this script in python can be used to analyse and present the most and least number of votes for any number of candidates and counties. The feature to list in form of dictionaries makes a great tool to present data in an organized manner. Also, python gives an easier way of automation in regards to loop through the rows of data to give results with much accuracy. The script with slight modification can be used 1) to find the counties or candidates with least number of votes and 2) to count votes in terms of states if needed simply by adding columns in the raw CSV data file.
